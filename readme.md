# Image Auto Label

This project uses [Google Cloud Vision](href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/") to add relevant topic labels on images in content through the power of AI.

This is a reference implementation for the proof of concept [WP Middleware](https://github.com/rheinardkorf/wp-middleware) plugin as discussed at WordCamp Brisbane 2018.

This plugin is pretty neat, but at the same time it is not fully polished. Please don't use it in production, but feel free to contribute to make it production ready ;)
